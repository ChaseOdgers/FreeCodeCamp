What do I wrap in div?
confused on flexbox inheritance
- nav bar example: 

problem I ran into: 
- modifying .nav-list li after establishing .nav-list as flexbox, learned that the li no longer has bearing
- on the list items as theyre now flex items

-when do i use display "flex" does it only apply at the container level?
